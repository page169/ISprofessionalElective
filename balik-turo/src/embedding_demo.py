Checkpoint 1 - Embedding Generation Demo
Balik-Turo: Filipino Folk Remedy & Herbal Medicine Assistant

Model choice
------------
Primary (recommended for the actual application, Checkpoints 2-3):
    sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  (Hugging Face)
    - Open-source, runs locally/offline once downloaded (no per-call API cost)
    - 384-dimension embeddings: small enough for a fast Chroma/FAISS index
      on a laptop-scale, 26-document knowledge base
    - Strong general-purpose semantic similarity performance for short,
      single-topic passages like our herbal remedy entries
    - Easy drop-in swap for a larger/multilingual model later (e.g.
      paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2) if Tagalog-heavy text needs
      better coverage

Why this matters for RAG: the vector index built in Checkpoint 2 is only as
good as these embeddings, so a model that captures "this is about a cough
remedy" vs "this is about a skin remedy" well is worth the small size cost.

A note on this environment
---------------------------
This script is written to run with sentence-transformers exactly as the
project will use it going forward (see `embed_with_sentence_transformers`
below). Downloading model weights from huggingface.co requires outbound
internet access, which this development sandbox restricts. Run this file
as-is on a normal machine with internet access and it will work.

For an executable, fully-offline sanity check *in this sandbox only*, the
script falls back to a TF-IDF vectorizer (scikit-learn) when the
sentence-transformers model can't be downloaded. This fallback is NOT the
embedding technique used in the actual application; it exists purely so we
can demonstrate a working embedding pipeline end-to-end without network
access. This is called out clearly in the printed output and the report.
